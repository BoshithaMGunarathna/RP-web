          Current interview processes are often subjective and limited in scope, failing to provide a holistic assessment of candidates. There is a need for an automated tool that integrates multiple evaluation techniques to offer a comprehensive and objective analysis of candidates' capabilities and suitability for roles.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Despite advancements in AI-driven recruitment systems, current automated interview tools remain limited in their ability to provide a holistic evaluation of candidates. While these systems effectively assess technical skills, they fall short in capturing critical behavioral and psychological attributes such as confidence, professionalism, stress resilience, and code maintainabilityâ€”factors essential to real-world job performance.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                This research aims to bridge these gaps by developing a multimodal interview system that integrates voice, visual, and physiological data with technical performance metrics. The proposed solution includes a hybrid confidence detector, a culturally-aware professionalism evaluator, a stress-adaptive coding environment, and a multi-dimensional code assessment model. Together, these innovations aim to deliver fairer, more comprehensive candidate evaluations and set new standards for ethical and effective AI-based hiring.
