# Automated Interview Process Research Project ‚Äì Website

Welcome to the official website of our research project on **Automating the Interview Process Using AI-Driven Analysis**. This platform serves as an informative hub to share our objectives, system architecture, team contributions, and ongoing progress in building an advanced, data-driven interview evaluation tool.

## üåê Project Overview

Traditional interviews often suffer from subjectivity, bias, and inconsistency. Our research project aims to develop a comprehensive, AI-powered interview platform that enhances fairness, transparency, and efficiency in candidate evaluation.

The system integrates multiple analytical components that assess various aspects of a candidate's performance, including voice analysis, emotional tone, problem-solving capabilities, code quality, and visual presentation.

## üéØ Research Objectives

- Automate initial and technical interview processes using AI.
- Evaluate candidate confidence, personality, and emotional state using voice and video analysis.
- Measure code complexity and maintainability to assess technical skills.
- Provide data-driven, unbiased reports to support HR decisions.

## üß† Key System Components

1. **Voice Confidence & Personality Detection**
   - Analyzes tone, pitch, and frequency.
   - Identifies confidence levels and personality cues.

2. **Emotion Analysis & Gamified Assessment**
   - Uses emotion recognition during technical problem-solving.
   - Engages candidates through interactive challenges.

3. **Code Complexity Measuring System** *(Team Member 2's Contribution)*
   - Collects code snippets and calculates complexity, maintainability, and correctness.
   - Uses established metrics like cyclomatic complexity, line count, and nesting depth.
   - Helps in shortlisting candidates based on clean, efficient code.

4. **Visual Interview & Attire Clarity Check**
   - Analyzes mock video interviews and video-based cover letters.
   - Evaluates attire, posture, and visual clarity to reflect professionalism.
